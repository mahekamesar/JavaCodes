    /*In Java regular expressions, the \\s sequence represents any whitespace character. This includes spaces, tabs, newline characters, carriage returns, and other whitespace characters.

        Here's what each part of \\s means:

        \\: This is an escape sequence in Java, representing a single backslash. Since the backslash is a special character in Java strings, you need to use \\ to represent a literal backslash.
        s: This is a metacharacter in regular expressions that matches any whitespace character.*/
